NexusChat is a web-based chat application developed for Next House Copenhagen Hostel. It features an AI assistant named Nexus, a friendly virtual mascot that answers guest questions about the hostel and the city of Copenhagen.

Built with React (Vite) on the frontend and Firebase Functions + OpenAI API on the backend, the app provides an interactive experience through a chat interface where guests can:

Ask anything about the hostel (WiFi, breakfast, check-in, etc.)

Receive friendly responses generated by GPT

Enjoy a custom visual design with a bubble-style chat and mascot avatar

This project was designed to enhance guest experience, reduce repetitive front desk tasks, and bring a playful, modern touch to hostel communication.
